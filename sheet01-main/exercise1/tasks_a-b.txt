The "man" command uses the environment variable MANPAGER, 
or if not set, falls back to PAGER and finally defaults to 
"less" as the helper program to display the content of the man pages.

To determine the default program used by the "man" command on our system, 
use the "man" command with the "--path" option followed by "man". 
The command is:
man --path man
This command will display the path to the man page, revealing the default program
used for displaying man pages on our system.

To find all occurrences of a keyword in the "less" command, 
we can use the "/" followed by the keyword for searching. 
To jump to specific lines in a file using "less," 
we can type the line number followed by "g" and then press Enter. 
To find this information, 
I would use the following commands:
man less
Inside the "less" man page, I would search for keyword
 occurrences using the "/" command followed by the keyword
 and look for instructions on jumping to specific 
lines by searching for the term "g" in the man page.
